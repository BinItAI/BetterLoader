        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        loader (callable, optional): A function to load an image given its path.
        is_valid_file (callable, optional): A function that takes path of an Image file
            and check if the file is a valid file (used to check of corrupt files)
        instance (sting, optional): Either 'train' 'test' or 'val' whether or not you want the train test or val split
        index (dict[string:list[string]], optional): A dictionary that maps each class to a list of the image paths for that class along with whetever other data you need to make your dataset
            this can really be whatever you want because it is only handled by train_test_val_instances.
        train_test_val_instances (callable, optional): A function that takes:
            a root directory,
            a mapping of class names to indeces, 
            the index,
            and is_valid_file
            and returns a tuple of lists containing the instance data for each of train test and val, 
            the instance data in the list is a tuple and can have whatever structure you want as long as the image path is the first element
                each of these tuples is processed by the pretransform
        class_data (tuple, optional): the first element is a list of the classes, the second is a mapping of the classes to their indeces
        pretransform (callable, optional): A function that takes the loaded image and any other relevant data for that image and returns a transformed version of that image

     Attributes:
        classes (list): List of the class names sorted alphabetically.
        class_to_idx (dict): Dict with items (class_name, class_index).
        imgs (list): List of (image path, class_index) tuples
